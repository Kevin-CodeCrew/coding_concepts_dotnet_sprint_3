# Coding Concepts Sprint 3 - C#

### What is C#
C# is a general-purpose, modern and object-oriented programming language. It was developed by Microsoft within the .Net initiative. .Net applications are multi-platform applications and framework can be used from languages like C++, C#, Visual Basic, COBOL etc. C# is among the languages for Common Language Infrastructure. C# is similar to Java syntactically and is easy for the users who have knowledge of C, C++ or Java.

Microsoft has extensive official documentation for.NET and C# [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/#language-sections) and [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/language-reference/keywords/)

C# source files typically have the file extension .cs. To create this program, first download and install the [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download). Then, execute the command dotnet new console -o yourProject to create a new program and a build script. The program and build script are in the files Program.cs and yourProject.csproj, respectively. You build and run the application with the run commands:
```
cd yourProject
dotnet run
```
